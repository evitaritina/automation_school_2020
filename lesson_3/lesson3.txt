Practice:
Write test for this class, specifications in comments:
public static double getWordComplexity(String word){
        /*
        Calculate complexity using following formula:
        1. each letter r (any cases) is +1.
        2. Each syllable is 0.5.
        For example margarins has 3 syllabes: mar-ga-rins
        and has 2 r letters, which is complexity 3.5
         */
        word = word.toLowerCase() + "_";
        Double complexity = 0.0;
        complexity += word.split(("r")).length - 1;
        complexity += (word.split("[a,a,e,e,i,i,o,u,u]").length-1)*0.5;
        return complexity;
    }
